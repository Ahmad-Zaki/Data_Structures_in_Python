## Introduction

Data structures & Algorithms are an essential part of programming. It comes under the fundamentals of computer science. It gives us the advantage of writing better and efficient code in less time. It is a key topic when it comes to Software Engineering interview questions so as developers, we must have knowledge of Data Structure and Algorithms.

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
Data structure is a way or a format how your data is stored in memory for effecient usage and retrieval.

This repository contains my implementation of some of the popular data structures in python.
